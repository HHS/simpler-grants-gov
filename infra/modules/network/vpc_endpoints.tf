# VPC Endpoints for accessing AWS Services
# ----------------------------------------
#
# Since the role manager Lambda function is in the VPC (which is needed to be
# able to access the database) we need to allow the Lambda function to access
# AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store (to fetch the database password) and
# KMS (to decrypt SecureString parameters from Parameter Store). We can do
# this by either allowing internet access to the Lambda, or by using a VPC
# endpoint. The latter is more secure.
