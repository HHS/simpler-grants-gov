# CI/CD

The CI/CD for this project uses [reusable Github Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows).

## 🧪 CI

### Per app workflows

Each app should have:

- `ci-[app_name]`: must be created; should run linting and testing
- `ci-[app_name]-vulnerability-scans`: calls `vulnerability-scans`
  - Based on [ci-app-vulnerability-scans](https://github.com/navapbc/template-infra/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci-app-vulnerability-scans.yml)

### App-agnostic workflows

- [`ci-docs`](./ci-docs.yml): runs markdown linting on all markdown files in the file
  - Configure in [markdownlint-config.json](./markdownlint-config.json)
- [`ci-infra`](./ci-infra.yml): run infrastructure CI checks

## 🚢 CD

Each app should have:

- `cd-[app_name]`: deploys an application
  - Based on [`cd-app`](https://github.com/navapbc/template-infra/blob/main/.github/workflows/cd-app.yml)

The CD workflow uses these reusable workflows:

- [`deploy`](./deploy.yml): deploys an application
- [`database-migrations`](./database-migrations.yml): runs database migrations for an application
- [`build-and-publish`](./build-and-publish.yml): builds a container image for an application and publishes it to an image repository

## ⛑️ Helper workflows

- [`check-ci-cd-auth`](./check-ci-cd-auth.yml): verifes that the project's Github repo is able to connect to AWS
