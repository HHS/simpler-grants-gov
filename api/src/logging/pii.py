"""Mask PII from log records.

This module defines a filter that can be attached to a logger to mask PII
from log records. The filter is applied to all log records, and masks PII
that looks like social security numbers.

You can add the filter to a handler:

Example:
    import logging
    import src.logging.pii as pii

    handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    handler.addFilter(pii.mask_pii)
    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.addHandler(handler)

Or you can add the filter directly to a logger.
If adding the filter directly to a logger, take note that the filter
will not be called for child loggers.
See https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logger.propagate

Example:
    import logging
    import src.logging.pii as pii

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.addFilter(pii.mask_pii)
