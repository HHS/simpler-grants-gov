class SearchQueryBuilder:
    """
    Utility to help build queries to OpenSearch

    This helps with making sure everything we want in a search query goes
    to the right spot in the large JSON object we're building. Note that
    it still requires some understanding of OpenSearch (eg. when to add ".keyword" to a field name)

    For example, if you wanted to build a query against a search index containing
    books with the following:
        * Page size of 5, page number 1
        * Sorted by relevancy score descending
        * Scored on titles containing "king"
        * Where the author is one of Brandon Sanderson or J R.R. Tolkien
        * With a page count between 300 and 1000
        * Returning aggregate counts of books by those authors in the full results

    This query could either be built manually and look like:

    {
      "size": 5,
      "from": 0,
      "track_scores": true,
      "sort": [
        {
          "_score": {
            "order": "desc"
          }
        }
      ],
      "query": {
        "bool": {
          "must": [
            {
              "simple_query_string": {
                "query": "king",
                "fields": [
                  "title.keyword"
                ],
                "default_operator": "AND"
              }
            }
          ],
          "filter": [
            {
              "terms": {
                "author.keyword": [
                  "Brandon Sanderson",
                  "J R.R. Tolkien"
                ]
              },
              "range": {
                "publication_date": {
                    "gte": 300,
                    "lte": 1000
                }
              }
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "aggs": {
        "author": {
          "terms": {
            "field": "author.keyword",
            "size": 25,
            "min_doc_count": 0
          }
        }
      }
    }

    Or you could use the builder and produce the same result:

    search_query = SearchQueryBuilder()
                .pagination(page_size=5, page_number=1)
                .sort_by([("relevancy", SortDirection.DESCENDING)])
                .simple_query("king", fields=["title.keyword"])
                .filter_terms("author.keyword", terms=["Brandon Sanderson", "J R.R. Tolkien"])
                .filter_int_range("page_count", 300, 1000)
                .aggregation_terms(aggregation_name="author", field_name="author.keyword", minimum_count=0)
                .build()
