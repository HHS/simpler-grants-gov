# Overview

The routes defined in this folder are routes that only
get enabled locally. They exist to make development
simpler and are never enabled non-locally.

Checks are put in place in several places to ensure
that these routes DO NOT work non-locally and are
never configured to run non-locally as they are
not secure.
