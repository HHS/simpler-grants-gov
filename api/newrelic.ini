# This file configures the New Relic Python Agent.
#
# The path to the configuration file should be supplied to the function
# newrelic.agent.initialize() when the agent is being initialized.
#
# The configuration file follows a structure similar to what you would
# find for Microsoft Windows INI files. For further information on the
# configuration file format see the Python ConfigParser documentation at:
#
#    http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html
#
# For further discussion on the behaviour of the Python agent that can
# be configured via this configuration file see:

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Here are the settings that are common to all environments.

[newrelic]

# You must specify the license key associated with your New
# Relic account. This key binds the Python Agent's data to your
# account in the New Relic service. For more information on
# storing and generating license keys, see
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#ingest-license-key
# license_key = # Supplied through NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY by AWS SSM.

# The application name. Set this to be the name of your
# application as you would like it to show up in New Relic UI.
# The UI will then auto-map instances of your application into a
# entry on your home dashboard page. You can also specify multiple
# app names to group your aggregated data. For further details,
# please see:
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apm/agents/manage-apm-agents/app-naming/use-multiple-names-app/
# app_name = # Parameterized by environment at the end of this file.

# When "true", the agent collects performance data about your
# application and reports this data to the New Relic UI at
# newrelic.com. This global switch is normally overridden for
# each environment below.
monitor_mode = false

# Sets the name of a file to log agent messages to. Whatever you
# set this to, you must ensure that the permissions for the
# containing directory and the file itself are correct, and
# that the user that your web application runs as can write out
# to the file. If not able to out a log file, it is also
# possible to say "stderr" and output to standard error output.
# This would normally result in output appearing in your web
# server log.
# TODO: Figure out where (in CloudWatch or Splunk) New Relic agent messages may need to be sent.
log_file = stderr

# Sets the level of detail of messages sent to the log file, if
# a log file location has been provided. Possible values, in
# increasing order of detail, are: "critical", "error", "warning",
# "info" and "debug". When reporting any agent issues to New
# Relic technical support, the most useful setting for the
# support engineers is "debug". However, this can generate a lot
# of information very quickly, so it is best not to keep the
# agent at this level for longer than it takes to reproduce the
# problem you are experiencing.
log_level = info

# High Security Mode enforces certain security settings, and prevents
# them from being overridden, so that no sensitive data is sent to New
# Relic. Enabling High Security Mode means that request parameters are
# not collected and SQL can not be sent to New Relic in its raw form.
# To activate High Security Mode, it must be set to 'true' in this
# local .ini configuration file AND be set to 'true' in the
# server-side configuration in the New Relic user interface. For
# details, see
# https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/subscriptions/high-security
high_security = false

# The Python Agent will attempt to connect directly to the New
# Relic service. If there is an intermediate firewall between
# your host and the New Relic service that requires you to use a
# HTTP proxy, then you should set both the "proxy_host" and
# "proxy_port" settings to the required values for the HTTP
# proxy. The "proxy_user" and "proxy_pass" settings should
# additionally be set if proxy authentication is implemented by
# the HTTP proxy. The "proxy_scheme" setting dictates what
# protocol scheme is used in talking to the HTTP proxy. This
# would normally always be set as "http" which will result in the
# agent then using a SSL tunnel through the HTTP proxy for end to
# end encryption.
# proxy_scheme = http

# Capturing request parameters is off by default. To enable the
# capturing of request parameters, first ensure that the setting
# "attributes.enabled" is set to "true" (the default value), and
# then add "request.parameters.*" to the "attributes.include"
# setting. For details about attributes configuration, please
# consult the documentation.
# TODO: Figure out if add'l attrs will be important to capture (e.g. in events or transaction traces) later on.

# When the response time of a controller action exceeds this
# threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to

# Apdex controller action - four times the Apdex T value.

# When the transaction tracer is on, SQL statements can
# optionally be recorded. The recorder has three modes, "off"

# string literals.

# Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack trace for a SQL

# 416: Range Not Satisfiable - We don't support ranges, if our API returns this, is on the user
# 422: Unprocessable Content - API Request validation issues fall under this
#
# Status codes that we may want to ignore in the future:
#
# - 400: Bad Request - Validation and extra parameter errors. Unclear if we want to catch pydantic ValidationErrors here so we're keeping them for now. Instead, selectively ignore specific error classes above.
