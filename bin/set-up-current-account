# This script sets up the terraform backend for the AWS account that you are
# currently authenticated into and creates the terraform backend config file.
#
# The script takes a human readable account name that is used to prefix the tfbackend
# file that is created. This is to make it easier to visually identify while
# tfbackend file corresponds to which AWS account. The account ID is still
# needed since all AWS accounts are guaranteed to have an account ID, and the
# account ID cannot change, whereas other things like the AWS account alias
# can change and is not guaranteed to exist.
#
# Positional parameters:
#   account_name (required) - human readable name for the AWS account that you're
#     authenticated into. The account name will be used to prefix the created
#     tfbackend file so that it's easier to visually identify as opposed to
#     identifying the file using the account id.
#     For example, you have an account per environment, the account name can be
#     the name of the environment (e.g. "prod" or "staging"). Or if you are
#     setting up an account for all lower environments, account name can be "lowers".
#     If your AWS account has an account alias, you can also use that.
