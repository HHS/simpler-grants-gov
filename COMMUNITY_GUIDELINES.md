# Community Organization and Governance

The grants.gov team is taking a community-first and open-source approach to the product development of this tool. We believe government software should be made in the open and be built and licensed such that anyone can download the code, run it themselves without paying money to third parties or using proprietary software, and use it as they will.

We know that we can learn from a wide variety of communities, including those who will use or will be impacted by the tool, who are experts in technology, or who have experience with similar technologies deployed in other spaces. We are dedicated to creating forums for continuous conversation and feedback to help shape the design and development of the tool.

We also recognize capacity building as a key part of involving a diverse open source community. We are doing our best to use accessible language, provide technical and process documents in multiple languages, and offer support to community members with a wide variety of backgrounds and skillsets. If you have ideas for how we can improve or add to our capacity building efforts and methods for welcoming people into our community, please let us know by filing an issue on our GitHub repository.

## Principles

Principles and guidelines for participating in our open source community are linked below. Please review these before joining or starting a conversation in this repo or one of the channels listed below. All community members are expected to adhere to these principles and guidelines and to the code of conduct when participating in community spaces such as code repositories, communication channels and venues, and events.

The following principles guide our data, product, and process decisions, architecture, and approach:

- "Open" means *transparent* and *participatory*.
- We take a modular and modern approach to software development.
- We build open-source software and open-source processes.
- We value ease of implementation.
- Fostering community includes building capacity and making our software and processes accessible to participants with diverse backgrounds and skillsets.
- Data (and data science) is as important as software and process. We build open data sets where possible.
- We strive for transparency in algorithms and places we might be introducing bias.

All community members are expected to adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Community Guidelines

When participating in the Simpler Grants open-source community conversations and spaces, we ask individuals to follow the following guidelines:

- When joining a conversation for the first time, please introduce yourself by providing a brief intro that includes:
  - your related organization (if applicable).
  - your pronouns (optional).
  - disclosure of any current or potential financial interest in this work.
  - your superpower, and how you hope to use it for this project.
- Embrace a culture of learning, and educate each other. Each person participating starts from a different point and with a different background. There are no dumb questions.
- Be courteous, respectful, and welcoming. We encourage individuals to voice their opinions and provide contributions, and we will do our best to welcome and encourage individuals who may be struggling to participate. Likewise, we expect individuals to recognize when they may be unknowingly intimidating others from participating and to temporarily step back to allow everyone else to participate.
- Contribute when joining synchronous conversations such as our community chats. Please don't feel the need to just sit back and observe while others talk!
