# Application Documentation

## Introduction

- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) React web application, written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov) provides themeable styling and a set of common components.
- [React-USWDS](https://github.com/trussworks/react-uswds) provides React components already with USWDS theming out of the box. For a reference point starting out, see `react-uswds-hello.tsx` which includes examples of react-uswds component usage.
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is included as a frontend workshop.

## 💻 Local Development

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) provides the React framework for building the web application. Pages are defined in the `app/` directory. Pages are automatically routed based on the file name. For example, `pages/[locale]/page.tsx` is the home page.
