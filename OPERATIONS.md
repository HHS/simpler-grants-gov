# Maintenances and Operation of Runtime System

## Deployment

### Deploying Every Service

This series of commands will deploy non-prod every service for you. Run them from the top level directory (where this file is located). If you want to run them all quickly, then run each block of bash in a new terminal. If you want to be more careful, run them all one at a time, from top to bottom, inspecting the output on every step.

```bash
terraform -chdir="infra/api/service" init -backend-config="dev.s3.tfbackend" -reconfigure
terraform -chdir="infra/api/service" apply -var "environment_name=dev"

terraform -chdir="infra/api/service" init -backend-config="staging.s3.tfbackend" -reconfigure
terraform -chdir="infra/api/service" apply -var "environment_name=staging"
```

```bash
terraform -chdir="infra/frontend/service" init -backend-config="dev.s3.tfbackend" -reconfigure
terraform -chdir="infra/frontend/service" apply -var "environment_name=dev"

terraform -chdir="infra/frontend/service" init -backend-config="staging.s3.tfbackend" -reconfigure
terraform -chdir="infra/frontend/service" apply -var "environment_name=staging"
```

```bash
terraform -chdir="infra/analytics/service" init -backend-config="dev.s3.tfbackend" -reconfigure
terraform -chdir="infra/analytics/service" apply -var "environment_name=dev"

terraform -chdir="infra/analytics/service" init -backend-config="staging.s3.tfbackend" -reconfigure
terraform -chdir="infra/analytics/service" apply -var "environment_name=staging"
```

### Updating to our Terraform Version

1. Install `tfenv`
2. Get the terraform version to install from `terraform_version` this file: https://github.com/HHS/simpler-grants-gov/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy.yml
3. Follow `tfenv` instructions to install and utilize the given terraform version

### Terraform State Locks

Terraform state locks happen when multiple terraform deployments try to roll out simultaneously.

You can fix them on CLI by:

1. Finding the job (via Github Action or otherwise) where the deployment failed. If you aren't sure, then it was probably in a Github Action. You can find a list of failing actions here: https://github.com/HHS/simpler-grants-gov/actions
2. Wait for the deployment that caused the state lock to finish. If you can't find it, just wait 30 minutes.
3. Identify the folder in which the state lock is happening. The `Path` attribute on the `Lock Info` block will identify this.
4. Open up your terminal, setup AWS (eg. `export AWS_PROFILE=grants-bla-bla-bla` && `aws sso login`), and cd into the folder identified above
5. Run `terraform init -backend-config=<ENVIRONMENT>.s3.tfbackend`, where `<ENVIRONMENT>` can be identified by the `Path` above.
6. Run `terraform force-unlock -force <LOCK_ID>` where `<LOCK_ID>` is the value of `ID` in your state lock message.
7. Re-run your deploy job

Sometimes CLI unlock won't work, that will look like (for example) the following error message:

> terraform force-unlock -force <LOCK_ID>
> Failed to unlock state: failed to retrieve lock info for lock ID <LOCK_ID>: unexpected end of JSON input

When that happens, you need to unlock it via DynamoDB in the AWS console.

1. Login to AWS
2. [Open the DynamoDB console](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodbv2/home?region=us-east-1)
3. [Open the tables tab](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/dynamodbv2/home?region=us-east-1#tables)
4. Click on the state locks table. There should only be one.
5. Click the `Explore Table Items` button
6. Find the item that corresponds to the currently locked state, you can get that by again looking at the `Path` attribute in your locked job.
7. Remove the `Digest` key, `Save and close`
8. Re-run your deploy job

## Scaling

All scaling options can be found in the following files:

API:

- [infra/api/app-config/dev.tf](infra/api/app-config/dev.tf)
- [infra/api/app-config/staging.tf](infra/api/app-config/staging.tf)
- [infra/api/app-config/prod.tf](infra/api/app-config/prod.tf)

Frontend:

- [infra/frontend/app-config/dev.tf](infra/frontend/app-config/dev.tf)
- [infra/frontend/app-config/staging.tf](infra/frontend/app-config/staging.tf)
- [infra/frontend/app-config/prod.tf](infra/frontend/app-config/prod.tf)

### ECS

Scaling is handled by configuring the following values:

- instance desired instance count
- instance scaling minimum capacity
- instance scaling maximum capacity
- instance CPU
- instance memory

Our ECS instances auto scale based on both memory and CPU. You can view the autoscaling configuration
here: [infra/modules/service/autoscaling.tf](infra/modules/service/autoscaling.tf)

### Database

Scaling is handled by configuring the following values:

- Database minimum capacity
- Database maximum capacity
- Database instance count

In prod, the database maximum capacity is as high as it goes. Further scaling past the point will require scaling
out the instance count. Effectively using the instance count scaling might require changes to our application layer.

### OpenSearch

- Search master instance type
- Search data instance type
- Search data volume size
- Search data instance count
- Search availability zone count

When scaling openSearch, consider which attribute changes will trigger blue/green deploys, versus which attributes
can be edited in place. [You can find that information here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/managedomains-configuration-changes.html). Requiring blue/green changes for the average configuration change is a
notable constraint of OpenSearch, relative to ECS and the Database.

## Yearly Rotations

We manage several secret values that need to be rotated yearly.

### Application Certificates

#### Application Certificates: Part 1: Generate A Cert

The process starts by generating a cert like so. You will need to generate the certs one at a time.

```bash
openssl genrsa -out api_simpler_grants_gov.key 2048
openssl req -new \
    -key api_simpler_grants_gov.key \
    -out api_simpler_grants_gov.csr \
    -subj "/C=US/O=Simpler Grants Gov/CN=api.simpler.grants.gov" \
    -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:api.simpler.grants.gov"
```

You give the `{url}.csr` file to HHS so that they can perform the next step. When they get back to you, proceed to part 2a

#### Application Certificates: Part 2a: Upload A Single Cert

You will get a zip file back from HHS containing the certificate. Inside the zip there will be one file. If it isn't called `{url}.cer` then rename it so that that's its name. That's the cert. Here you have two options. If the cert isn't plain text, you need to turn it into plain text. How to determine if something is plain text or not can be done by `cat`'ing the file and seeing if it has a bunch of ï¿½'s in it, that means it's binary. Binary certs can be turned into plain text, then uploaded, like so:

```bash
openssl x509 -inform DER \
    -in api_simpler_grants_gov.cer \
    -out api_simpler_grants_gov.pem # the file extensions here are functionally arbitrary

aws acm import-certificate --certificate fileb://api_simpler_grants_gov.pem \
    --private-key fileb://api_simpler_grants_gov.key
```

For plain text certs, that would look like:

```bash
aws acm import-certificate --certificate fileb://api_simpler_grants_gov.cer \  # again, the file extensions here are functionally arbitrary
    --private-key fileb://api_simpler_grants_gov.key
```

Later on (eg. during part 3), you might get the following error:

> NET:ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID

If that happens, then that means that something went wrong with this step, eg. step 2a. In that case, you need to redo your work in form of step 2b.

#### Application Certificates: Part 2b: Upload Multiple Certs

If there are multiple certificates (eg. a chain certificate is included) then there will be given another file called something like `{url}_chain.cer` and the commands look more like this

```bash
openssl x509 -inform DER \
    -in api_simpler_grants_gov.cer \
    -out api_simpler_grants_gov.pem

openssl x509 -inform DER \
    -in api_simpler_grants_gov_chain.cer \
    -out api_simpler_grants_gov_chain.pem

aws acm import-certificate --certificate fileb://api_simpler_grants_gov.pem \
    --certificate-chain fileb://api_simpler_grants_gov_chain.pem \
    --private-key fileb://api_simpler_grants_gov.key
```

Or if one of the certs is in plain text, then the command looks like this

```bash
aws acm import-certificate --certificate fileb://api_simpler_grants_gov.pem \
    --certificate-chain fileb://api_simpler_grants_gov_chain.cer \
    --private-key fileb://api_simpler_grants_gov.key
```

In summary, Inspect which certs are binary, which are plain text, and decrypt them as needed. Then import the file with multiple certs into `--certificate-chain`.

#### Application Certificates: Part 3: Attach to Load Balancer

This is the last step where the cert actually starts being used. Login to the AWS console and open up this page:

https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=us-east-1#LoadBalancers:v=3

From there:

- Click on the load balancer whose cert you are updating, like `api-prod`
- Scroll down to "Listeners and rules"
- Click `HTTPS:443`
- Click `Certificates`
- Click `Add certificate`
- Choose the certificate that you just uploaded, you can determine this by looking at the `CertificateArn` CLI output, or by otherwise [inspecting the AWS console here](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home?region=us-east-1#/certificates/list).
- Add the certificate. This UI is confusing and likely subject to change on AWS's end, so the exact text of the buttons of the buttons isn't included in this documentation.
- `Remove` the old certificate.

At this point the new certificate should start being served... after 5 ~ 10 minutes. Check your website periodically during that turn to confirm the rotation of your cert.

### Login.gov Certificates

*These certificates were last updated in December 2024*

We need to manage a public certificate with login.gov for [private_jwt_auth](https://developers.login.gov/oidc/token/#client_assertion) in each of our environments.

To generate a certificate run:
```shell
openssl req -nodes -x509 -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private.pem -out public.crt -subj "/C=US/ST=Washington DC/L=Washington DC/O=Nava PBC/OU=Engineering/CN=Simpler Grants.gov/emailAddress=grantsteam@navapbc.com"
```

Navigate to the [login.gov service provider page](https://dashboard.int.identitysandbox.gov/service_providers)
and for each application edit it, and upload the public.crt file. Leave any prior cert files alone until we have
switched the API to using the new one.

Go to SSM parameter store and change the value that maps to the `LOGIN_GOV_CLIENT_ASSERTION_PRIVATE_KEY` value
for the given environment to be the value from the `private.pem` key you generated.

After the next deployment in an environment, we should be using the new keys, and can cleanup the old certificate.

#### Prod Login.gov

Prod login.gov does not update immediately, and you must [request a deployment](https://developers.login.gov/production/#changes-to-production-applications) to get a certificate rotated.

For Prod, assume it will take at least two weeks from creating the certificate, before it is available for the API, and until it is, do not change the API's configured key.

## New Relic

There are three ways to interact with New Relic: UI, CLI, or API. Most interactions will be done via the UI.

### New Relic API via Terraform

We use the New Relic via means of Terraform. [You can via the New Relic Terraform API documentation here](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/newrelic/newrelic/latest/docs/guides/getting_started). To setup Terraform for New Relic, perform the following steps:

1. [Login to New Relic](https://one.newrelic.com)
2. [Navigate to the API keys page](https://one.newrelic.com/admin-portal/api-keys/home)
3. Create a key of key type "user"
4. Copy the key value
5. Set the key value, region,  in your `.zshrc` `.bashrc` or similar:

```bash
export NEW_RELIC_ACCOUNT_ID=1234 # Found in the URL among other places. eg. https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?account=< ACCOUNT ID HERE>
export NEW_RELIC_API_KEY="EXAMPLE"
export NEW_RELIC_REGION="US" # Always "US".
```

You will then be able to interact with New Relic via Terraform. There's some New Relic Terraform configuration inside of the `infra/accounts/` folder for example. From this point you can use normal Terraform CLI commands to interact with New Relic, `terraform init` `terraform apply` etc.
