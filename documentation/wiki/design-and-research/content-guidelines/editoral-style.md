# Editorial style

### External style guides

We follow a few trusted external style resources to ensure our content is clear, consistent, and user-centered:

* [**HHS Web Style Guide**](https://www.hhs.gov/web/policies-and-standards/web-style-guide/index.html): Our primary reference, which adopts **AP style** with specific exceptions.
* [**U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)**](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/): We follow USWDS guidance for content within design components, such as using **sentence case** for buttons and form elements.
* [**PlainLanguage.gov**](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/): These federal plain language guidelines serve as our foundation for writing in a way that’s clear, concise, and accessible to all users.

### Editorial perspective

Consistent use of pronouns is key to creating a clear and cohesive editorial perspective. Switching between first-person ("my account") and second-person (_"your account"_) can confuse users and disrupt the flow of communication. We use the second person (e.g., _"your account"_) throughout the product to maintain a consistent, user-focused voice. This approach reinforces clarity, reduces ambiguity, and aligns with how most users think about interacting with a product from their perspective.

## Mechanics

### Contractions

Using contractions (like _we're', it's' or you'll_) helps our writing sound more natural, approachable, and human, just like how people speak in everyday conversation. They soften overly formal language, making our content feel more friendly and accessible, especially in user-facing experiences. By using contractions, we create a tone that’s warm, relatable, and easier to connect with.

### Capitalization

**Simpler.Grants.gov uses sentence case in most cases.** Sentence case makes content easier to scan and digest, especially in long text. It also aligns with how many people naturally speak and write, making it feel more conversational. In contrast, excessive use of title case can engender formality, making our product look stiff and unwelcoming.

**Sentence case examples**

* Body text
* Column headers
* Labels and other UI components
* Progress indicator labels
* Modal titles
* Buttons (per [USWDS](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/button/))
* H2 form section headings
  * In application forms, H2s should be styled in sentence case. See Simpler's version of Form SF-424 for an example.
* H3 subheadings and lower

**Title case examples**

* Page titles and H1 headings
* H2 page section headings
* The subject line for Simpler.Grants.gov newsletters
  * The subject line follows a template where "\[Month] Updates" uses title case, while the latter portion after the pipe symbol uses sentence case. Example: "May Updates | Building momentum with every release"

**Uppercase examples**

* Opportunity status, only when the status is a single word, and benefits from emphasis on the Search results page. Examples: CLOSING, OPEN.&#x20;
