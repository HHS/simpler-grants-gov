# Editoral style

### External style guides

We follow a few trusted external style resources to ensure our content is clear, consistent, and user-centered:

* [**HHS Web Style Guide**](https://www.hhs.gov/web/policies-and-standards/web-style-guide/index.html): Our primary reference, which adopts **AP style** with specific exceptions tailored to federal websites.
* [**U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)**](https://designsystem.digital.gov/design-principles/): We follow USWDS guidance for content within design components, such as using **sentence case** for buttons and form elements.
* [**PlainLanguage.gov**](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/): These federal plain language guidelines serve as our foundation for writing in a way that’s clear, concise, and accessible to all users.

### Editorial perspective

Consistent use of pronouns is key to creating a clear and cohesive editorial perspective. Switching between first-person ("my account") and second-person (_"your account"_) can confuse users and disrupt the flow of communication. We use the second person (e.g., _"your account"_) throughout the product to maintain a consistent, user-focused voice. This approach reinforces clarity, reduces ambiguity, and aligns with how most users think about interacting with a product from their perspective.

## Mechanics

### Contractions

Using contractions (like _we're', it's' or you'll_) helps our writing sound more natural, approachable, and human, just like how people speak in everyday conversation. They soften overly formal language, making our content feel more friendly and accessible, especially in user-facing experiences. By using contractions, we create a tone that’s warm, relatable, and easier to connect with.

### Capitalization

Simpler.Grants.gov uses sentence case in most cases. Sentence case makes content easier to scan and digest, especially in long text. It also aligns with how many people naturally speak and write, making it feel more conversational. In contrast, excessive use of title case can engender formality, making our product look stiff and unwelcoming.\
