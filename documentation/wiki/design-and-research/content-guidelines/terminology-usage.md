| Research showed that the term _"Posted"_ was unclear to users when describing an opportunityâ€™s status. Testing validated that _"Open"_ is a clearer and more intuitive alternative, especially since it directly contrasts with _"Closed."_ This pairing reinforces a simple and recognizable distinction between available and unavailable opportunities. | Posted          | Open                          |

### Under discussion

* Forecasted. Our research was inconclusive in determining whether this term was the most appropriate choice to refer to an opportunity. We will audit the existing Grants.gov site to determine the change management requirements and the level of risk associated with changing "forecasted" to another term.&#x20;
