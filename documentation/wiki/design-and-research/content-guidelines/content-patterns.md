### Indicating required and optional fields

Clearly communicating whether form fields are required or optional helps users complete forms with confidence and reduces input errors. Use the following standards to ensure consistency and clarity across all form interfaces:

* When all fields are required: State `All fields as required.` as helper text. Do not use asterisks to indicate required fields.
* When all fields are optional: State `All fields are optional.` as helper text.&#x20;
* When there is a mix of required and optional fields: State `A red asterisk`` `<mark style="color:red;">`(*)`</mark>` ``indicates a required field.` Then, apply the red asterisk after the label for any required fields.
* Don't indicate the quantity of required fields. e.g., "2 fields are required."
