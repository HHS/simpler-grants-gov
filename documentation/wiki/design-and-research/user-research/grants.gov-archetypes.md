# Grants.gov archetypes

Toward the beginning of the Simpler.Grants.gov project in 2023, we conducted a research study to gather insights from applicants, potential applicants, and grantmakers. As a result, we identified four major archetypes of Grants.gov applicants and identified four themes that cover the problems our work should address. Additionally, we found the most common barriers users face when applying on Grants.gov. We’re using these findings to guide our work.

### The methodology

Applicants and grantmakers were selected for user interviews to understand their experience better using Grants.gov. We recruited equitably to ensure a diverse pool of participants.

Of the interviewed applicants, 26% were first-time, 39% were occasional, and 34% were frequent applicants.

With the findings from these interviews, we defined user archetypes and general themes to guide the Simpler.Grants.gov user experience.

#### Research objectives:

* Examine existing user journeys and behaviors, identifying how Grants.gov fits into their overall approach
* Learn from user experiences, roles, challenges
* Identify barriers and how a simpler Grants.gov can create a more intuitive user experience, especially for new users

### Applicant archetypes

Archetypes are compelling summaries that highlight the types of applicants that Grants.gov serves. They’re informed by and summarize user research data and represent user behaviors, attitudes, motivations, pain points, and goals. We’ll use these archetypes to influence our design decisions, guide the product’s direction, and keep our work human-centered.

#### The Novice

Applicants lacking familiarity with the grant application process, including first-time or infrequent applicants and those who never apply

Novices are often new to the grants application process. They face a steep learning curve when finding and applying for funding opportunities. Solving their needs will generate a more inclusive Grants.gov experience.

#### The Collaborator

Applicants who've applied before. They work with colleagues or partner organizations to increase their chances of success.

Collaborators have more familiarity with Grants.gov. However, they face challenges with coordinating application materials and often resort to tools and resources outside of Grants.gov.

#### The Maestro

Frequent applicants familiar with Grants.gov, who are often directly responsible for managing multiple applications at once

Maestros have an established approach to applying, which may include software and tools outside of Grants.gov. Their primary concerns are determining grant feasibility and staying ahead of deadlines.

#### The Supervisor

Applicants who have a more senior role at organizations and have less frequent direct involvement with Grants.gov than Maestros.

Supervisors are responsible for oversight, approvals, final submissions, and keeping registrations current. Their time is limited, as they're often busy with the organization's other needs.

### General themes

The existing Grants.gov website works best for those who use it regularly. Larger organizations and teams of Collaborators and Maestros are typically more familiar with the ins and outs of the system. To create a simpler Grants.gov with an intuitive user experience that addresses the needs of all archetypes, four themes were defined:

#### Frictionless functionality

Reduce the burden on applicants and grantmakers, from both a process and systems perspective, by addressing the pain points that negatively affect their experience

#### Demystify the grants process

Ensure that all users have the same easy access to instructional and educational information that empowers them to have a smoother, more informed, and more confident user experience

#### Sophisticated self-direction

Meet users where they are during crucial moments by providing a guided journey through opt-in contextual support that reduces their need to find help outside the system

#### Create an ownable identity

Create a presence that reflections our mission and supports our users through visual brand, content strategy, and user interface design systems

### Where can we have the most impact?

The most significant burden is on Novice to become an expert on the grants process and system. To execute our mission, there is a need to improve awareness, access, and choice. This requires reaching out to those unfamiliar with the grant application process.

There are many common barriers that users face:



<table><thead><tr><th width="252">Barrier</th><th>Impact</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><h4>Digital connectivity</h4></td><td>Depending on availability and geography, a stable internet connection is not guaranteed to support a digital-only experience.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Expertise</h4></td><td>Small organizations face higher turnover, and alumni often take their institutional knowledge and expertise with them when they leave.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Education</h4></td><td>It often requires a high level of education to comprehend the complexity and language of funding opportunity announcements.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Confused by announcements</h4></td><td>Novices have difficulty determining their eligibility and understanding the details of the funding opportunity announcement.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Organization size</h4><p><br></p></td><td>Not all organizations have dedicated resources for seeking grant funding. Many are 1-person shops who are trying to do it all.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Cognitive load</h4></td><td>Applicants often apply for funding through several agencies, requiring they learn multiple processes and satisfy varying requirements.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Lost at the start</h4></td><td>Novices don’t see a clear call-to-action for getting started, and they have trouble finding the one-on-one help at the beginning of the process.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Time</h4></td><td>Most individuals wear a lot of hats (community advocate, program lead, etc.) and "grants applicant" is only part of their responsibilities and requires efficiency.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Overworked</h4></td><td>New organizations are often too burdened with internal paperwork and infrastructure to support external funding and reporting.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Language</h4></td><td>Applicants are faced with a lot of jargon without context or definitions, which is especially difficult when English is not their native language.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Overwhelmed by search</h4></td><td>New applicants misuse the keyword search function and have trouble understanding the acronyms and terminology.</td></tr><tr><td><h4>Blindsided by requirements</h4></td><td>New applicants are caught off guard by SAM.gov registration and often miss the format and file name requirements.</td></tr></tbody></table>
