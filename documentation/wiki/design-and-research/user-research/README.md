# User research

The Simpler.Grants.gov team regularly conducts user research to inform our design work, including usability tests and user interviews.

You can [sign up to participate in future research](https://ethn.io/91822).

We also use participatory design practices as part of our research toolkit. Over eight months, members of a cohort of real Grants.gov users work with the product and design team sign practices to influence the user experience of Simpler.Grants.gov.
