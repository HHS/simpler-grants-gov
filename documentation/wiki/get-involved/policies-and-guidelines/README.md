## Security and Responsible Disclosure Policy

The Simpler Grants project adheres to the same security and disclosure policies as the HHS. Review the HHS Disclosure Policy to understand the policy and all websites within its scope to learn more.

This policy describes _what systems and types of research_ are covered, _how to send_ us vulnerability reports, and _how long_ we ask security researchers to wait before publicly disclosing vulnerabilities.
