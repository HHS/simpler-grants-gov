## Content Privacy

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

Content that you share in Simpler.Grants.gov communications channels is **never** fully private. Administrators can view all of the content shared in each channel, and the content in these channels is subject to [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests](https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html).
{% endhint %}

There are a few important considerations regarding the privacy of content that is shared in any of the channels listed above:

* **Admins can view all messages:** Administrators of each channel can view and delete or modify content shared within that channel. This includes channels with the semblance of privacy, such as direct messages within Slack.
* **Content is subject to FOIA:** All content shared in these channels is also subject to a [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request](https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html). That may include content categorized as "internal," pending FOIA request approval. This further underscores the importance of **never** sharing sensitive or prohibited information in these changes.&#x20;
