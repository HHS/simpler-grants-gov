# Incident Response Protocol

## Observing Inappropriate Content or Behavior

If any community member notices content or behavior that violates our Code of Conduct during any of our meetings or on any communication channel, they are encouraged to report it immediately according to the following process:

1. **Immediate Action**: If possible, the person witnessing the incident should ask the offending party to stop the inappropriate behavior.
2. **Report the Incident**: Report the incident to the admin team via a private message on the platform where the incident occurred or via email. Provide as much detail as possible, including screenshots or logs if available.
3. **Admin Review**: The admin team will review the report, investigate the incident, and determine the appropriate response, which may include a warning, temporary ban, or permanent expulsion from the community.
