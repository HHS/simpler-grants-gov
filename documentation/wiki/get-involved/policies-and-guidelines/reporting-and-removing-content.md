# Reporting and removing content

If content that violates our community guidelines is posted in any of our communication channels, please follow the steps below to remove the content. If you are the one who posted it by accident, please remove it if possible. If someone else has posted it or you are in a channel you do not have privileges to delete, contact the appropriate Simpler.Grants.gov administrator to remove it.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** Many of the steps to remove content involve contacting platform administrators.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## Slack

### If it was a message that _you_ posted:

1. Select the `More options` menu (the three vertically stacked dots that appear when you hover over your post)
2. Choose either `Edit message` or `Delete message` to remove the content

### If it was a message that _someone else_ posted:

1. Contact a Slack admin
2. The Slack admin will follow the steps above to delete the post from that channel

## GitHub

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**

Only _administrators_ can remove sensitive content from GitHub because content added to GitHub will remain visible in the history of the codebase until an administrator scrubs it from the repository.
{% endhint %}

1. Contact a GitHub administrator who is a software engineer
2. They will scrub the content from the history of the code repository
