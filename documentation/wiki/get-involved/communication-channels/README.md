# Communication channels

We collaborate on the project using various public and private channels. Find out what information or conversations you'll find in each.

## Public channels

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Content privacy**

Content that you share in Simpler.Grants.gov communications channels is **never** fully private. Administrators can view all of the content shared in each channel, including those with the semblance of privacy, such as direct messages within Slack. The content in these channels is also subject to [Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests](https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html).
{% endhint %}

### Discourse forum

We use Discourse as our primary platform for discussing open-source development.

### All public channels

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Prohibited activity**

Prohibited activity (e.g., violations of our Code of Conduct or the Federal Hatch Act) is never allowed in any channel. Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to moderate and remove prohibited content from all communication channels.
