# Spring 2025 Collaborative Coding Challenge

The Collaborative Coding Challenge hosted by Simpler.Grants.gov starts on Monday, March 10th! Make sure you don’t miss out on it. This will be a great chance to collaborate with developers, subject matter experts, product managers, and designers from around the country. Winners will be chosen by community favorite voting among all participants, so start planning how you’ll make your submission stand out.

Who Should Participate?

* Software Developers – Building functional prototypes or MVPs
* Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) – Managers, analysts in state/local government who search and apply for federal grants
* Product Managers & Designers – Helping shape user experience and project direction
* Non-Technical Contributors – Brainstorming, planning, project management, etc.

Whether you have extensive coding experience or simply a passion for problem-solving, your insights will help shape the next generation of federal grants solutions.
