# Community events

The Simpler.Grants.gov team periodically hosts public events to engage our community with the ongoing development work.

#### Coding Challenges

Opportunities for external contributors to help the Simpler.Grants.gov team solve problems and develop site functionality.

The format varies. Software engineers of all experience levels are encouraged. Some, but not all, Coding Challenges also have a role for designers and researchers. The event is virtual but can vary from a weekend to several weeks.

#### Simpler.Grants.gov Big Demo

About every four months, our team hosts a public virtual demonstration of the features and work we produced in the previous 4-month development cycle. &#x20;
