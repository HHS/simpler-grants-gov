# Event Submissions & Winners

We concluded the second [Simpler.Grants.gov](http://simpler.grants.gov/) hackathon last week! This collaborative coding challenge took place over 3 weeks in the month of march. Participants were asked to submit proposals and code which would demonstrate an extension or improvement on our grant seeking API. Our participants were able to deliver some incredible work, which you can find on our Wiki. We want to congratulate the winners of this event:

**Bassirou Goumbane** had the following to say about their experience participating in the hackathon

> Just a quick reflection after receiving the latest [Simpler.Grants.gov](http://simpler.grants.gov/) Newsletter — and wow, it aligns so well with the spirit of what I shared earlier!
>
> The message about collaboration, open-source contributions, and building for the public good really resonated with me. Especially the example of two participants teaming up — one handling the technical side and the other focusing on UX/UI — to create something impactful together. That’s the kind of synergy I was referring to: different paths, different strengths, same destination.
>
> Whether we’re walking away with $500 or $1,500, the real prize might be what we can build together if we combine our unique insights. As they said, this platform is more than a challenge — it’s a space to connect, grow, and contribute to a bigger mission.
>
> Thanks again to everyone participating and supporting this journey. Let’s keep learning and building for something greater!
