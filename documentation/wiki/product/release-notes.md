### We’ve launched our first iteration of user profile and permissions.&#x20;

Our research showed that users previously struggled to determine who within their organization had the necessary permissions, information, and access which resulted in a confusing chain of misdirected inquiries. These new improvements set the stage that will allow our users to collaborate together when submitting applications and clearly identify individuals with key roles who are responsible for critical tasks like renewing the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and inviting users to build out their teams.&#x20;

### We launched new changes to the Activity Dashboard.

We have created a hub that allows users to quickly access their frequently visited features like saved searches and queries, and introduced applications for ease of access and navigation. To solve for the key pain point of finding active grants and managing work, this Activity Dashboard centralizes where you can manage active work, giving users a clearer, personalized way to keep track of their progress.
