### Filtering Search Results by Posted Date

In response to a highly requested feature, users may now filter their search queries by Posted Date. Users may now search and click ‘Filter’ to reveal an accordion drop-down menu that can filter funding opportunities within a posted date of 3, 7, 14, 30, or 60 days.

{% column width="75%" %}
### Primary EBIZ POC Role Protections&#x20;

The team has made sure that users cannot be removed from an organization if they are also the EBIZ POC for that organization by disabling the ‘Remove’ button. This will ensure that organizations do not lose access to the EBIZ POC administrative functions required to use and access Simpler Grants.

### Simplified URL structures for applications

The team has updated all application and form pages to point to new routes defined by new information architecture. For example, the previous URL of&#x20;

> _simpler.grants.gov/workspace/applications/application/\[applicationId]_&#x20;

will now be&#x20;

> _simpler.grants.gov/applications/\[applicationId]._&#x20;

All previous URL routes will automatically redirect to the new routes.

## [Simpler.Grants.Gov](http://simpler.grants.gov) Release Notes - December 23, 2025

December 23rd’s update brings [several new changes](https://github.com/HHS/simpler-grants-gov/releases/tag/2025.12.23-1): &#x20;

{% columns %}
{% column width="25%" %}
#### New Feature
{% endcolumn %}

{% column width="75%" %}
### [Simpler.Grants.Gov](http://simpler.grants.gov) is now the default for searching for opportunities.

With Simpler Search launching as the default experience, we can get a wider array of users providing feedback about their experience. It also solidifies Simpler.Grants.Gov as the standard for search and helps to iteratively build and deliver working software methodically. Just over the last week, we have seen a 200% increase in users visiting the search page.&#x20;

Users can still access the classic search by first logging into Grants.gov and then searching for opportunities. Some funding opportunities may be removed or modified by the agency that created them, and are no longer accessible from any Grants.gov systems (Classic or Simpler). These changes are unrelated to the switch over to the Simpler Search.
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

{% columns %}
{% column width="25%" %}
#### New Feature
{% endcolumn %}

{% column width="75%" %}
### Activity history is now available on applications.

The new activity history section of the application page shows what changes have been made to an application, when they were made, and who made each change. This surfaces important information to applicants collaborating on applications.
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

{% columns %}
{% column width="25%" %}
#### New Improvement
{% endcolumn %}

{% column width="75%" %}
### A clearer, persistent confirmation after applying.

Instead of a temporary success alert, applicants will now see a permanent confirmation message at the top of their application page after successfully submitting an application. This message provides important information about the submission, what to expect next, and who to contact if they have any questions.

## Launching [Simpler.Grants.Gov](http://simpler.grants.gov) Release Notes - December 10, 2025!

We're excited to announce the launch of release notes for Simpler.Grants.Gov! Our goal for these updates is to regularly showcase new features, important bug fixes, improvements to enhance your experience, and more. This update for December 10th brings [several new changes](https://github.com/HHS/simpler-grants-gov/releases/tag/2025.12.10-1): &#x20;

{% column width="25%" %}
#### New Feature&#x20;
{% endcolumn %}

{% column width="75%" %}
### We’ve launched our first iteration of user profile and permissions.&#x20;

Our research showed that users previously struggled to determine who within their organization had the necessary permissions, information, and access which resulted in a confusing chain of misdirected inquiries. These new improvements set the stage that will allow our users to collaborate together when submitting applications and clearly identify individuals with key roles who are responsible for critical tasks like renewing the Unique Entity Identifier (UEI) and inviting users to build out their teams.&#x20;
{% endcolumn %}
{% endcolumns %}

{% column width="25%" %}
#### New Feature
{% endcolumn %}

{% column width="75%" %}
### We launched new changes to the Activity Dashboard.

We have created a hub that allows users to quickly access their frequently visited features like saved searches and queries, and introduced applications for ease of access and navigation. To solve for the key pain point of finding active grants and managing work, this Activity Dashboard centralizes where you can manage active work, giving users a clearer, personalized way to keep track of their progress.
