# Internal Wiki ADR

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Last Modified:** 2024-11-22
* **Deciders:** Lucas Brown, Julius Chang, Billy Daly, Sarah Knopp, Margaret Spring, Andy Cochran

## Overview

### Context and Problem Statement

The SimplerGrants program needs a way of storing and sharing information about the program for internal team members. A wiki format is ideal because it provides context and information for users to help them navigate through content and requires few clicks for team members to obtain what they need. The team can also make their own updates to content on the wiki, so it is a self-service solution. The current solution, Gitbook, has received negative feedback from program team members due to concerns around usability. A re-evaluation of the needs for an internal wiki platform is conducted here, and the criteria have been updated to reflect current program priorities.

### Assumptions

* This ADR assumes only internal team members will use the internal wiki. External groups we interface with, such as Co-Design Group and Code Challenge participants, should only use the external wiki or the document sharing repositories.
* This ADR does not cover the public wiki or any needs related to the public wiki. These should be addressed separately.
* Additional decisionmaking will be required by creating norms for the external wiki and doc sharing tools. This will inform where we are storing what information.

### Decision Drivers

#### **Must Have**

* Hosting: SaaS is needed so as not to increase program overhead with hosting management.
* Usability: Non-technical users must be able to access and create content with minimal training or guidance.
* Comments: Reviewers should be able to leave in-line comments on content that they are reviewing.
* Version History: Editors should be able to see and restore previous versions of a given page.
* Multi-Media: The platform should support multiple types of media (e.g. videos, images, file uploads, tables, diagrams) with minimal configuration.
* Onboarding Costs: Onboarding new members to the platform should be relatively inexpensive, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. licensing fees).
* Maintenance Costs: It should not be prohibitively expensive to maintain the wiki, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. hosting fees).

#### **Nice to Have**

* Web Analytics: The platform should provide support for tracking site usage and other web analytics.
* Content Review: The ability to put new changes into a change request or similar state and allow for a reviewer to preview before it is merged is not critical given the tool is only for internal use.
* Open Source: The tool used to manage and host the wiki content should be open source, if possible.
* Calendar page: Shared calendars have been a program challenge. The ability to sync and display calendars for multiple teams on a wiki page would be a nice asset that would resolve a current pain point.

### Options Considered

* Confluence
* Notion
* Gitbook
* wiki.js
* Google Workspace (Document Sharing Solution)

### Decision Outcome

The SimplerGrants.gov team does not find enough of a need for a dedicated internal wiki to purchase a wiki platform or continue on with our internal Gitbook wiki. Instead, a combination of our Gitbook external wiki and our chosen Doc Sharing platform, Google Workspace, will be used to host the documents the team needs.&#x20;

The projectâ€™s dedication to transparency and developing in the open lends itself well to the idea that some documentation that can be made public about the work, should be made public. However, the team also recognizes that there is a need to keep certain documentation private (such as security related matters or administration guidelines for our open source community, for example) and these documents can be stored on Google Drive.

Additional discussion is required to form norms around the Doc Sharing and External Wiki solution to ensure that it meeds all of the needs of the team to replace the internal wiki.

#### Positive Consequences

Moving to this solution will reduce overhead for the team, as we will not have to learn and manage yet another tool and contents of it, and also ensures we are spending contract funds wisely.&#x20;

#### Negative Consequences

There will need to be time and effort put into updating and migrating all of the exisiting content in the internal wiki. There is also a lack of a knowledge base type space that is just for program team members,

## Pros and cons of the options

### Wiki.js

Wiki.js is an open source wiki platform that seeks to replicate many of the basic features found in SaaS offerings like Confluence or GitBook.

#### Details

* **Pricing:** Free
* **Hosting:** Self-hosted
* **Usability:** Steep learning curve for non-technical users
* **Comments:** Yes
* **Version History:** Limited Support
* **Multi-Media:** Yes
* **Onboarding Costs:** Cost would be the investment for users to learn the platform
* **Maintenance Costs:** None
* **Web Analytics:** Total control over data, Git-sync and API available

* **Open Source:** Yes
* **Calendar page:** No

#### Pros

* Open source and self-hosted
* Robust control over access and permissions
* Supports Google Analytics integration
* Supports external contributions through GitHub PRs
* Full control over data

#### Cons

* Significantly less intuitive than other wiki options
* Documentation for the tool is lacking
* Requires significant investment of staff time for initial configuration and ongoing maintenance
* Features are less mature than other SaaS offerings like Confluence or GitBook

#### Using Google Workspace/Document Sharing Solution as a wiki tool

Given that our program Document Sharing solution is low cost, and utilizing a wiki is technically a way of sharing documentation, an assessment of using Google Workspace as a wiki is included to find out if it is usable and what the benefits or drawbacks are.

* **Price:** None- already owned by program contractors
* **Hosting:** SaaS
* **Usability:** Perceived as challenging given information is buried in documents without any way to denote what to open other than external instructions or file names. No wiki format is available in Google Workspace.
* **Comments:** Yes
* **Version History:** Yes
* **Multi-Media:** Yes
* **Onboarding Costs:** Expected to be high in terms of labor given IA is based on folder structure
* **Maintenance Costs:** Expected to be high in terms of labor given IA is based on folder structure
* **Web Analytics:** None
* **Content Review:** No functionality available for this
* **Open Source:** Proprietary
* **Calendar page:** Team members can see their own workspace calendars and any calendars theyâ€™ve added. No hosted wiki page with a calendar is available.
