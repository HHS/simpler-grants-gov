# Cross-Program Team Health Survey Tool

* **Status:** Proposed
* **Last Modified:** November 20, 2024
* **Deciders:** P\&D team

## Overview

### Context and Problem Statement

The SimplerGrants project requires a reliable, easy-to-use, and cost-effective tool to conduct regular team health surveys. These surveys are critical for measuring psychological safety, workload management, and overall team satisfaction. The tool must support efficient data collection, analysis, and reporting processes.

### Decision Drivers

* **Cost-Effectiveness:** The tool must be affordable and offer good value for money.
* **Ease of Use:** It should be simple for both survey creators and respondents to use, requiring minimal training.
* **Integration:** The tool needs to integrate smoothly with other Google Workspace products already in use.
* **Data Analysis:** Capable of basic data analysis and reporting to aid in quick decision-making.
* **Accessibility:** Must be accessible to all team members and support mobile responses.
* **Security and Compliance:** Ensure data security and comply with our data protection policies.

### Considered Options

* **Google Forms:** Integrated with Google Workspace, known for its simplicity and integration capabilities.
* **SurveyMonkey:** Offers comprehensive survey tools and advanced analytics but at a higher cost.
* **Microsoft Forms:** Suitable for teams embedded within the Microsoft ecosystem, with good integration with Office 365.
* **Typeform:** Provides a highly interactive and engaging survey experience but may be more expensive.

## Decision Outcome

Google Forms has been selected as the preferred tool for conducting our team health surveys. Its integration with Google Workspace, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness are key factors in this decision. Google Forms provides sufficient capabilities for designing surveys, collecting responses, and performing basic analyses, which meets our projectâ€™s needs without additional financial investment.

### Positive Consequences

* **Cost Savings:** As part of Google Workspace, Google Forms comes at no additional cost to our team.
* **Ease of Use:** Familiar interface for users already accustomed to Google products, reducing the learning curve.
* **Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with other Google services like Google Sheets for data analysis and Google Drive for storing survey data.
* **Rapid Deployment:** Quick to set up and deploy surveys, enabling timely feedback collection.

### Negative Consequences

* **Limited Analytical Tools:** While Google Forms supports basic analysis, it lacks the advanced analytical capabilities of more specialized survey tools.
* **Fewer Customization Options:** The aesthetic and functional customization options are more limited compared to options like Typeform.

## Follow-up Actions

* **Implementation Plan:** Develop a detailed plan for survey design, distribution, and data analysis using Google Forms.
* **Training Sessions:** Organize brief training sessions for team leads to familiarize them with form creation and data collection.
* **Integration Check:** Ensure all team members have access to Google Workspace and understand how to access and fill out forms.
* **Pilot Survey:** Conduct a pilot survey to test the effectiveness of Google Forms and adjust the survey based on feedback.
