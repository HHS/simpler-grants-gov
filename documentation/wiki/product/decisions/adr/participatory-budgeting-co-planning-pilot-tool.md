### Context and Problem Statement

SimplerGrants will run a Participatory Budgeting (PB) pilot as a mechanism to increase community involvement in feature prioritization. The pilot aims to empower community members to submit ideas, create proposals, and vote on which features the team should build. This requires a lightweight, accessible, and user-friendly tool that allows participants to vote for features that they want to see the team build next.

Due to the pilot’s short timeline and exploratory nature, the team needs to select a tool for the pilot that allows for immediate implementation with minimal technical overhead.

In the process of running the pilot, we have changed the term used to describe this process. We are no longer using “Participatory Budgeting” in favor of “Co-Planning”.

### Assumptions

* The PB pilot will be limited to 6 participants voting on 7 proposals
* Proposals will be selected by members of the SimplerGrants team, rather than submitted by members of the public
* Members of the Simpler.Grants.gov team will be assigned to work on the top X proposals over the course of Y sprints

### Decision Drivers

* Ease of Use: Tool must be simple for both community participants and the internal project team to use.
* Low Cost: Free or existing tools are preferred.
* Rapid Implementation: Must be implementable in a sprint.
* Customizability: Must support flexible question design and lightweight workflows.
* No Training Overhead: Minimal user onboarding or workflow configuration.

### Options Considered

* Google Forms
* GitHub
* COTS Participatory Budgeting Software such as Decidim

### Decision Outcome

The team selected Google Forms as the tool for implementing the PB pilot due to its availability, ease of use, and immediate deployment capability.

### Positive Consequences

* Free and widely accessible tool already in use.
* Very low technical barrier for community participation.
* Allows for quick configuration and iteration.
* Supports lightweight form logic and structured data export.

### Negative Consequences

* Not purpose-built for participatory budgeting.
* Lacks proposal deliberation or collaboration tools.
* Voting limited to basic question types.
* Google form’s limited feature set for proposal submission, deliberation, and voting will likely require us to move to a new tool for future PB rounds

### Pros and Cons of the Options

#### Google Forms

Details\
Free Google Workspace form tool. Supports surveys, multiple choice, short answer, and logic branching. Easy export to Sheets.

Pros:

* Readily available and familiar
