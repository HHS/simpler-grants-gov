## Context and Problem Statement

The communications platform deliverable identifies a series of platforms through which the Grants API project needs to engage both internal and external stakeholders. One of these platforms is a wiki for storing notes, documents, and other content about the project. Ideally we would select a platform that balances ease of use and flexibility with the cost of implementing and maintaining the wiki.

The goal of this ADR is to evaluate a series of potential wiki platforms and determine which one best fits the needs and objectives of this project based on the decision criteria outlined below.

## Decision Drivers

#### Must Have

* **Usability:** Non-technical users should be able to access and create content with minimal training or guidance.
* **Public Access:** Members of the public should be able to read public documentation in the wiki without needing to sign up or login to a service.
* **Content Review:** Collaborators should be able to review and edit draft content before those changes are published.
* **Comments:** Reviewers should be able to leave in-line comments on content that they are reviewing.
* **Version History:** Editors should be able to see and restore previous versions of a given page.
* **Multi-Media:** The platform should support multiple types of media (e.g. videos, images, file uploads, tables, diagrams) with minimal configuration.
* **Internationalization (i18n):** The platform should provide support for displaying content in multiple languages.
* **Web Analytics:** The platform should provide support for tracking site usage and other web analytics.
* **Onboarding Costs:** Onboarding new members to the platform should be relatively inexpensive, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. licensing fees).
* **Maintenance Costs:** It should not be prohibitively expensive to maintain the wiki, both in terms of staff time/resources and direct costs (e.g. hosting fees).

#### Nice to Have

* **External Contributions:** Members of the public should be able to suggest changes to wiki content and internal stakeholders should be able to review those contributions before they are published.
* **Data Access:** Content generated and stored in the wiki should be accessible outside of the wiki platform, either through syncing content to an HHS owned repository or through an official API.
* **Machine Readability:** The wiki platform should also support storing and exposing content in a machine-readable format so that certain types structured data can be managed within and accessed from the wiki without parsing.
* **Open Source:** The tool used to manage and host the wiki content should be open source, if possible.
* **Authority to Operate (ATO):** Because the wiki is a support tool rather than a production service, it doesn't _need_ to be covered under the Grants.gov ATO. However, being covered under the existing ATO is an advantage if, in the future, we want to use it to support our production service (e.g. hosting training materials for grant applicants or grantors)

## Options Considered

* [Confluence](../../../decisions/adr/confluence/) - _NOT chosen_ because of limits around data access and content review
* [Notion](../../../decisions/adr/notion/) - _NOT chosen_ because of limits on version history and content review
* [GitHub Wiki](../../../decisions/adr/gh-wiki/) - _NOT chosen_ because of limited feature set and issues with usability
* [GitBook](../../../decisions/adr/gitbook/) - _Chosen_ because of support for content review and GitHub syncing
* [WikiJS](../../../decisions/adr/wiki-js/) - _NOT chosen_ because of issues with usability and requirements for ongoing maintenance

## Decision Outcome

We have decided to use **GitBook** as our wiki platform because it balances the usability and maintainability of a SaaS offering like Confluence with key features around data access and content review.

Although it is a proprietary tool, it has become a standard platform for managing documentation within open source projects, mainly because it emphasizes version control within the documentation and enables bi-directional syncing of content between GitBook and GitHub.

### Positive Consequences

* Wiki content can be presented in a more usable format for editing and reading, while still being version-controlled alongside our code in GitHub
* Non-technical users who are not familiar editing content directly in markdown can easily create and modify pages (if they have a GitBook license)
* Contributions and changes to existing documentation can be reviewed before they are published

### Negative Consequences

* Users who don't have a license to edit and manage content in GitBook (i.e. members of the public) can only make suggested edits or contributions through creating Pull Requests (PRs) in GitHub which can present a high barrier to entry for non-technical users
* Because GitBook isn't covered under the existing Grants.gov ATO, we will not be able to use it for production services. If in the future we want to use GitBook as part of our production service, we'll need to seek ATO approval.

### Back-up Options

If we can't get coverage for GitBook under the existing ATO, we should pursue one of the following solutions:

* **Wiki.js** if we want to prioritize data access and open source tools but are willing to compromise on maintenance costs and usability
