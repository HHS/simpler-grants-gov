## Context and Problem Statement

The communications platform deliverable identifies a series of platforms through which the Grants API project needs to engage both internal and external stakeholders. One of these platforms is an analytics platform for tracking key metrics during the launch of the first version of simpler.grants.gov and as the project continues to grow. We will evaluate top 3-5 analytics tools, including analytics.gov and Google Analytics, to identify the best fit for our specific needs and objectives. The selected tool should provide valuable insights and data to help us measure and optimize the platform's performance.

## Decision Drivers <!-- RECOMMENDED -->

#### Must Have

- **Data tracking capabilities**: solution should be able to track the essential metrics and events relevant to the project's goals, such as page views, user interactions, and other custom events.
- **Data visualization and reporting**: The tool should offer clear and comprehensive data visualization and reporting features to present data in a way that is easy to understand and interpret for multiple audiences (public, internal HHS, etc.)
- **Integration with existing systems**: consider whether the analytics tool can seamlessly integrate with the project's existing infrastructure, and other tools used in the development process. We will have a content management system in the future and we should have forward thinking to ensure it could be compatible with various CMS options.
- **Real-time data processing**: Assess whether the analytics tool can provide real-time data processing capabilities, enabling timely responses to critical events.
- **Data privacy and security**: Ensure that the selected tool complies with data privacy regulations and provides robust security measures to protect sensitive information.
- **Scalability**: Consider whether the analytics tool can handle the expected growth in data volume and user traffic as the project expands.
- **Cost**: Evaluate the pricing structure of the analytics tool.
- **Customization and flexibility**: Determine the level of customization and flexibility offered by the tool to tailor it to the specific needs and requirements of the project.
- **Support and documentation**: Check the availability of technical support, documentation, and community forums to aid in implementation and troubleshooting.
- **User-friendly interface**: Consider the ease of use and intuitiveness of the tool's interface, enabling team members to efficiently navigate and extract insights.

#### Nice to Have

- **Open Source:** The tool used to manage and host the analytics should be open source, if possible.

## Options Considered

- [Analytics.usa.gov](https://analytics.usa.gov/)
- [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/provision/#/provision)
- [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/)
- [Adobe Analytics](https://business.adobe.com/products/analytics/adobe-analytics.html)
- [Matomo](https://matomo.org/)

## Decision Outcome <!-- REQUIRED -->

We recommend moving forward with analytics.usa.gov through the Digital Analytics Program for the public facing analytics. It is required for all public-facing government agency websites. The platform aligns well with our goals due to its robust data tracking capabilities, allowing us to monitor essential metrics and custom events critical to our project's success. Its comprehensive data visualization and reporting features ensure that data can be presented in an easily understandable format for various audiences, including the general public and internal stakeholders at HHS. Since it is run by the Digital Analytics Program, we have greater confidence in the data and security standards. It is free for government agencies. Additionally, it allows us to align with other government agencies and ensure transparency to public.

DAP cannot be used for authenticated pages. We recommend Google Analytics with any logged in or authenticated pages. Since DAP is powered by Google Analytics, it makes sense to have the same Analytics platform on those pages as well. An assumption is that we will be able to connect the user sessions between authenticated and the public site together. However, if it is not possible to stitch the user journey (unauthenticated to authenticated and back and forth) together, it is worth revisiting the analytics tool selection.

### Positive Consequences <!-- OPTIONAL -->

- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: With an analytics platform, our project can gather valuable data and insights about usage and identify where there are shortfalls to our product. It can allow us to ensure we are building an accessible solution for the public. This data-driven approach enables informed decision-making and allows teams to identify trends, opportunities, and areas for improvement.
- **Improved Performance**: Analytics platforms help track key performance indicators (KPIs) and measure the success of various initiatives and deliverables. By monitoring these metrics, we can optimize our strategies and improve overall performance.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Understanding user behavior through analytics helps tailor products, services, and content to meet users' needs and preferences leading to a better user experience.

### Negative Consequences <!-- OPTIONAL -->

- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Collecting and analyzing user data can raise privacy concerns, especially with the increasing focus on data protection. We must handle data responsibly and set a high standard for compliance.
- **Data Overload**: Too much data without proper analysis can overwhelm teams and lead to decision paralysis. It's important to focus on relevant metrics and insights to continue moving forward.
- **Misinterpretation of Data**: Misinterpreting or misrepresenting data can lead to incorrect conclusions and misguided strategies. Proper data analysis and understanding are essential to draw accurate insights.
- **Cost and Resource Allocation**: Implementing and maintaining an analytics platform can be costly and resource-intensive that goes beyond just the cost of the tool.
- **Learning Curve**: Adopting new analytics platforms may require training and time for team members to become proficient, potentially affecting productivity during the initial stages.

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- OPTIONAL -->

### Analytics.usa.gov

The Digital Analytics Program (DAP) offers a web analytics tool, training, and support to federal agencies. The program is a shared service provided by the Technology Transformation Services (TTS) at the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA).

DAP provides federal agencies with:

- Free web analytics tools for public-facing federal websites that are comprehensive and easy-to-use
- Scalable infrastructure for measuring a broad range of .gov sites (large and small)
- Training on analytics tools and reporting
  - View upcoming trainings and talks ¬ª
  - View past recorded trainings ¬ª
  - Ongoing help-desk support around implementation, data, and reporting

#### Details

- The public reporting page, analytics.usa.gov, is powered from the Google Analytics account that DAP manages. Currently, the DAP code snippet is implemented at grants.gov.
- Currently powered by Universal Analytics (UA), but we will have access to both UA and GA4. On July 1, 2024, the Digital Analytics Program (DAP) will replace Universal Analytics (UA) with Google Analytics 4 (GA4).
- DAP is required: On November 8, 2016, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released a memorandum on [Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/legacy_drupal_files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf) (PDF, 1.2 MB, 18 pages), which requires executive branch federal agencies to implement the DAP JavaScript code on all public facing federal websites.
- Details on the code are available at the [DAP Github Repo](https://github.com/digital-analytics-program/gov-wide-code). Under the Code Capabilities Summary there are details on the types of data that are collected.
- The DAP script should only be applied to public-facing pages. Public-facing web pages are defined as those that can be accessed without any authentication or login, and are not part of an otherwise ‚Äúprivileged session.‚Äù
- The DAP script tag should not be placed on pages visited during logged-in sessions. Notably, other seemingly ‚Äúpublic‚Äù pages that can be accessed without authentication may also be part of privileged sessions; for example, a password reset page that is accessed by clicking a link in an email is not appropriate for DAP code because it assumes the visitor has the privilege of control over the email account used to provide the link.

#### Pros

- DAP is free for government agencies
- DAP provides insights across government agencies. It delivers an unprecedented, government-wide view of how the public interacts with federal websites.
