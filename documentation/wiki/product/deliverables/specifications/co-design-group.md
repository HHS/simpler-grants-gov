## Overview

### Summary

* **What:** Define scope and establish the necessary administrative work to prepare for onboarding target underserved communities to build a Co-Design Group around the Simpler.Grants.gov initiative
* **Why:** Ensures that Simpler.Grants.gov HHS decision makers design with the most underserved communities in the grants ecosystem and create continuous feedback loops to ensure equitable product development. This includes framing strategic problems, roadmap development, designing solutions, and iteration.&#x20;
* **Who**
  * The most underserved applicant individuals/groups within the grants ecosystem
  * Internal Simpler.Grants.gov stakeholders

**Out of scope**

* Defined plans for individual Co-Design Group activities
* We will have other forms of user research for more diverse user communities that will be handled outside of this 30k deliverable
* Onboard participants to the Co-Design Group and host a Co-Design Group session. We will onboard participants and kick-off a Co-Design Group in a future, separate deliverable

### Business value

#### Problem

Setting up a Co-Design Group with HHS requires planning and coordination with various stakeholders. We want to set up the planning processes so that we can more smoothly transition into a future deliverable of kicking off the Co-Design Group sessions.&#x20;

Setting up a Co-Design Group helps us address the following problems:&#x20;

* Firstly, the current grant making system privileges certain groups above others according to access to power and resources, making grants distribution highly inaccessible to specific groups.&#x20;
* Secondly, the most impacted underserved communities have not been concretely identified or involved in the Simpler.Grants.gov project, which inhibits Simpler.Grants.gov stakeholders from framing and solving specific contextual problems faced by these underserved communities in tandem with product build.&#x20;
* Thirdly, there are no research protocols or process for obtaining participant consent that proactively mitigates potential participant harm.&#x20;
* Finally, the product roadmap has not been designed to integrate opportunities for executing and implementing insights from user research, which would mitigate risks in user adoption and usage.&#x20;

#### Value

By completing the administrative and planning efforts to establish the Co-Design Group, we are able to remove blockers and start the work to recruit and host Co-Design Group sessions.&#x20;

By identifying and directly involving representatives of the Novice archetype, [identified through previous research](https://simpler.grants.gov/research), along with other underserved communities in project design, Simpler.Grants.gov HHS decision makers increase the likelihood of identifying and solving the right problems, those that will increase grants access to underserved communities. Moreover, building relationships with these communities will allow internal stakeholders to identify and uplift existing community designed solutions with Simpler.Grants.gov work, thereby removing the risk of duplication of effort and increasing the chance of user adoption. To this end, value is rooted in [Design Justice Principles](https://designjustice.org/read-the-principles), which centers the experiences of underserved end users throughout the entire framing, execution, and evaluation of project planning and delivery and acknowledges and extends the reach of already existing community designed solutions. By improving the experience and access for the most underserved communities, we improve the experience and access for everyone who uses the service.

Once created, the Co-Design Group will enable Simpler.Grants.gov internal stakeholders to more effectively implement best practices in user research by identifying opportunities for research ahead of time, mitigating risk, and more quickly standing up generative and evaluative studies with a pre-screened target user panel. The Co-Design Group will develop research protocols and obtain participant consent to ensure that participants are protected from harm that might arise from government stakeholders obtaining potentially sensitive data.

#### Goals

This effort allows us to…

* Set the foundations to bring the most impacted applicants into partnership with grants.gov internal stakeholders to frame, plan, design, and solution grants experience
* Create continuous feedback loop between community groups already working on behalf of marginalized community and allows grants.gov internal stakeholders to contribute to their existing solutions and build with (not for)
* Increase speed of participant recruitment for studies that aim to gather insights center user needs and behaviors throughout the product development lifecycle
* Improve strategy and proactive planning for future grants.gov work with Co-Design Group participants to frame problems and contribute insights that will guide roadmap development based on the real challenges users navigate in their lives

### User stories

* As a **HHS staff member**, I want to:
  * center the voices of those who are directly impacted by the outcome of the design process so that I can ensure that our solutions lead to sustainable positive outcomes
* As a **Co-Design Group administrator and project maintainer**, I want:
  * a streamlined process for collaborating with Co-Design Group members so that I can ensure that there is continuous feedback loop throughout strategic planning and product development
  * to ensure that the Co-Design Group includes representatives from a range of communities facing limited access so that they can reflect diverse voices and perspectives of those impacted by the outcomes
  * a longer-term view and tactical plan for how we will leverage the Co-Design Group so I can build trust with the group, set expectations, and right-size capacity needed to run the group for a defined duration of time
  * a manageable size of participants that matches the need of the project and capacity of the team
  * ensure that participants understand how their data will be used, obtain their consent, and that I have a way of protecting and anonymizing their data
* As a **grantor**, I want:
  * Simpler Grants.gov to be simple, effective, and accessible and work for all communities and individuals in the grants ecosystem so that it’s easier to attract a wide range of candidates
* As an **applicant and a member of the general public**, I want:
  * Simpler Grants.gov to be simple, effective, and accessible and work for all communities and individuals in the grants ecosystem so that it’s easier to find and apply for grants

## Planning

### Assumptions and dependencies

What functionality do we expect to be in place _**before**_ work starts on this deliverable?

* Method/platform for holding and protecting participant PII, Ethn.io, will need to be procured

Is there any notable functionality we do _**not**_ expect to be in place before works starts on this deliverable?

* Translations

### Not in scope

List of functionality or features that are explicitly out of scope for this deliverable.

* Defined plans for individual Co-Design Group activities
* This effort will not include more than one Co-Design Group engagement schedule beyond applicants
* Onboarding participants to the Co-Design Group
* Conduct sessions with participants for the Co-Design Group

### Open questions

<details>

<summary>What are the PRA requirements?</summary>

We can fast track specific approvals under the overall existing generic clearance. Fast tracks usually take 3-5 days. Felix Lorenzo at HHS owns this process.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Will we provide translations for people for whom English is not their first language?</summary>

It is likely that people whose first language is not English are more disadvantaged than other communities. We may be limited in our ability to provide real-time translations in this initial initiative, but we should plan how we can engage those communities. We should be able to provide text materials in other languages but real-time translations may be difficult.

We could potentially focus on a demographic segment where users who are fluent in English but not their first language attend sessions that help us get some input into this underserved population

</details>

<details>

<summary>Would we need a 508-compliance review of any materials (PDFs, slide decks, etc.) we're preparing for the Co-Design Group?</summary>

No 508 compliance review is required during planning. We'll be using standard, tested, accessible tools (email, Ethnio, etc.). We will evaluate subsequent materials and deliverables as needed during kickoff and ongoing operations.&#x20;

</details>

## Implementation

### Translations

Does this deliverable involve delivering any content that needs translation?

* No, as we will not be onboarding participants in this deliverable, we will not know what translations will be needed by participants.&#x20;

If so, when will English-language content be locked? Then when will translation be started and completed?

* n/a

### Services going into PROD for the first time

This can include services going into PROD behind a feature flag that is not turned on.

* The tools for procurement and dispersing compensation will be a new tools utilized on the project

### Services being integrated in PROD for the first time

Are there multiple services that are being connected for the first time in PROD?

* The tool for procurement and dispersing compensation and managing recruitment

### Data being shared publicly for the first time

Are there any fields being shared publicly that have never been shared in PROD before?

* n/a

### Security considerations

Does this deliverable expose any new attack vectors or expand the attack surface of the product?

* The recruitment and participant management tool will store PII data and we may need to have security approval to use the tool.&#x20;

If so, how are we addressing these risks?

* We will check with MH and HHS security to ensure that we have permissions to use the tool selected
