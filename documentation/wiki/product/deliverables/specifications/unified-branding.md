## Technical description

### **Branding identity, marketing, and communications audit**

**Description**&#x20;

Initiating the data collection phase to inform the initial internal/external synthesis that will inform branding efforts. Gathering metrics, user engagement, feedback, and relevant data from various sources, such as newsletters, grantor communications, research findings, legacy brand documentation, etc.&#x20;

**Goals**&#x20;

* Complete audit of current brand landscape using collateral, brand standards, marketing material, social media, data, and other relevant sources&#x20;
* Complete audit of competitor and similar organizations’ brand identities&#x20;
* Consolidate data in a shared repository or folder for collaborative access and synthesis&#x20;
* Analyze the current brand with a thorough audit and define a clear brand position that is aligned with organizational goals. These efforts inform the design of the brand identity

### **Primary and secondary brand audience identification**

**Description**&#x20;

Starting with a deep look at all the audience info and internal/external user groups, we can then define the different audiences for the brand and potentially the language/outreach/identity needs they have.

The brand identity will not only be the specific users of grants.gov. It will be policymakers, members of the media, and internal HHS/Grants staff who work on the product. The new brand will need to account for their needs and focus as stakeholders.

**Goals**&#x20;

* Define the primary and secondary brand audiences for Grants
* Define how we engage with those responsible for governance internally

### Brand positioning, characters, and behaviors

**Description**

Develop and iterate on the brand positioning statement. From there, develop and iterate on the brand characters and behaviors.

* Brand Characters: The combination of five distinct characteristics that we share as an organization. We demonstrate them through our behaviors.
* Brand Behaviors: Short actionable statements that interpret our characteristics into clear guidance for how we look, speak and act. They guide anyone representing Grants – through design, in writing, or in person

**Goals**

* Define the what the key differentiators and brand position is for grants in the wider ecosystem.&#x20;
* Define, iterate on, and finalize a set of five of brand characters and their behaviors

### Develop Key Messages

**Description**

Create compelling, memorable, and consistent messaging that effectively communicates Grants.gov identity and unique value. Key messages define what the Grants.gov stands for, its personality, and the key benefits it offers to its audience. We’ll craft these statements by conducting research with the PAC so that messages resonate with our target audiences.&#x20;

**Goals**

* Develop the value proposition
* Develop a set of compelling, memorable statements that can be used across audience types&#x20;
* Test and develop 2-3 key messages for each audience type

### Deliver brand strategy

**Description**

Deliver the approved brand strategy to the team for approval

**Goals**

* Deliver and get approval for all key brand strategy and communications items

### Develop visual concepts

**Description**

A set of activities that use the audit, brand behaviors, and key messaging frameworks to collaboratively develop 2 visual directions. The tasks are focused on getting feedback and participation from a wide variety of stakeholders and using activities to focus the team on how the mission gets represented visually.

**Goals**

* Involve stakeholders in the visual brainstorming process&#x20;
* Develop 2 visual directions for selection by stakeholder

### Develop visual identity system

**Description**

Develop a final brand identity and all the associated assets, templates, and guidelines.

**Goals**

* Deliver a final brand guidelines and all the associated assets and rules
* Gain alignment from all key stakeholders on the brand direction&#x20;

## Planning

### Assumptions and dependencies

What functionality do we expect to be in place _**before**_ work starts on this deliverable?

* n/a

Is there any notable functionality we do _**not**_ expect to be in place before works starts on this deliverable?

* The Participant Advisory Community deliverable will be starting at a similar time as this effort. While it it's a nice-to-have to get PAC involvement in the branding decisions, the timelines may not apply and we can incorporate PAC involvement of the brand in a future deliverable&#x20;

### Not in scope

List of functionality or features that are explicitly out of scope for this deliverable.

* Final approvals from leadership&#x20;
* The websites and public spaces where the assets may be used (such as, logos) will not be updated in this deliverable

### Open questions

<details>

<summary>Do we need to consider how we will share these assets with the public while making sure bad actors do not utilize the assets?</summary>

See security risk section.

</details>

## Integrations

### Translations

Does this deliverable involve delivering any content that needs translation?

1. No, not in this deliverable

If so, when will English-language content be locked? Then when will translation be started and completed?

1. n/a

### Services going into PROD for the first time

This can include services going into PROD behind a feature flag that is not turned on.

1. Branding assets will be introduced. We will also need to determine where assets will be published and shared. This will most likely use existing services, such as the wiki or the repo but it will be determined in this effort&#x20;

### Services being integrated in PROD for the first time

Are there multiple services that are being connected for the first time in PROD?

n/a

### Data being shared publicly for the first time

Are there any fields being shared publicly that have never been shared in PROD before?

1. Not necessarily fields but these branding assets may be shared publicly

### Security considerations

Does this deliverable expose any new attack vectors or expand the attack surface of the product?

1. We may need to consider how we can share branding assets in an open source project while considering the risk of bad actors using the assets for unintended purposes&#x20;

If so, how are we addressing these risks?

1. Currently, anyone can copy branding and images from the site itself so it should not be a different if it is in a repository. We will explore how different audiences will interact with the brand. For example, internal staff may get a simple URL to access the logo, or do we need to consider building it in to the tools. HHS has the basics up on a public page, but not all the stuff like powerpoint decks and letterhead. so we should consider a middle-ground. See the guidelines for use here:  https://www.hhs.gov/web/policies-and-standards/web-policies/logo-seal-and-symbol-policies/index.html
