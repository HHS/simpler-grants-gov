## Objectives

The goal of the SimplerGrants initiative is to **make Grants.gov...**

* **Easier for grant seekers**\
  Reduce applicant burden by simplifying the process of discovering and applying for grants.
* **More accessible for underserved communities**\
  Expand access to grant-eligible communities by designing for those who are underserved by the current grants process.
* **More efficient for grantors**\
  Reduce grantor burden by streamlining the process of publishing and managing grants.
*   **More transparent and participatory for the public**

    Build stakeholder trust by actively engaging the public in planning, design, implementation, and reporting.

## Product roadmap

The features and functionality we plan to deliver as part of the SimplerGrants initiative is currently tracked on a public [product roadmap in GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/HHS/projects/12/views/8). We currently plan in 4-month increments, but hope to build out a longer-term backlog of anticipated features as the project continues.

## Key product terms

The following terms are used to categorize items in our roadmap, we've defined them below and provided examples to help folks understand
