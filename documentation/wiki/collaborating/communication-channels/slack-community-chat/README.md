### 3. Understanding Direct Messages

* As an open source community, we try to keep conversations in public channels to make sure that the conversation is open and viewable to all participants. We recommend that you err on the side of posting in a public channel if you can.
* Use direct messages to communicate privately with individual team members if the&#x20;
* You can also create group messages for small team discussions.

## Using Slack for Project Contributions

### 1. Communication Etiquette

* Follow the[ code of conduct](../../get-involved/policies-and-guidelines/) that has been set by the Simpler Grants community
* When possible please use public channels instead of private or group DMs to make sure that we are creating a resource for everyone in the community.&#x20;
* Avoid posting personally identifiable information on slack. This is a public chat platform and anything posted can be seen by the general public.

### 2. Sharing Updates

* Use appropriate channels to share project updates, announcements, or important information.
* Utilize threads to keep conversations organized and focused.

### 3. Asking Questions

* Don't hesitate to ask questions in relevant channels or through direct messages.
* Prefix your question with "@channel" or "@here" if it's urgent or requires immediate attention.
  * This will notify everyone in the channel, so only use in case extreme urgency.&#x20;

### 4. Collaborating on Code

* Share code snippets or GitHub links directly in Slack channels for quick feedback.
* Use [#topic-code-review](https://betagrantsgov.slack.com/archives/C06JS9Y6249) for requesting code reviews and discussions.

### 5. Meeting Coordination

* Use Slack to schedule meetings, share agendas, and coordinate with team members.
* Utilize integrations like Google Calendar or Zoom to sync meeting schedules.

## Best Practices and Conventions

### 1. Channel Guidelines

* Each channel may have specific guidelines or rules outlined in the channel description. Familiarize yourself with these guidelines before participating.

### 2. Notifications Management

* Customize your notification settings to ensure you receive relevant updates without being overwhelmed.
* Consider muting channels or threads that are less relevant to your role or interests.

### 3. Use threads to continue a conversation instead of posting to the main channel

* When you see a message that you would like to respond to in the main channel, please make use of the threads feature to keep the main channels clear and concise.&#x20;
  * A thread can be created on a new post in the main channel by hovering over the message and clicking "reply in thread" on the toolbar that appears.
  * You can join an existing thread by clicking on the Reply underneath a message that already has an ongoing thread.
* When in a thread, only the people who are currently involved in that thread will get notifications, which helps to keep notification spam down for all members of the main channel.
  * If you need to get the attention of someone not in the thread, you can use the @\<username> command, which will notify them that they were mentioned in the thread.
  * You can also choose to send a response to both the thread and main channel if you belive that a threaded message should be seen by everyone.&#x20;
