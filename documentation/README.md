# Documentation for the Grants Equity Project

This folder contains documentation for the Grants Equity Project.

## Goals

Our vision is for the following to become true:

Grants.gov is the simplest, most inclusive, and most gratifying way to find and apply for financial assistance ever built, inside or outside the federal government. Grants.gov helps ensure that no communities are underserved by the federal government.

See [goals.md](./goals.md) for more information about the vision and goals for the project.

## Milestones

The [milestones](./milestones) directory contains information about our milestones for the modernization project.

[The milestone short descriptions file](./milestones/milestone_short_descriptions.md) contains brief descriptions of upcoming milestones. The [individual milestones](./milestones/individual_milestones) directory contains detailed descriptions of the project milestones.

## Decisions

Important technical and programmatic decisions are contained in the [decisions](./decisions/) directory, captured using the [architectural decision record format](https://adr.github.io) and written in markdown.
