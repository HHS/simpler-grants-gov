- **Related Issue:** [#103](https://github.com/HHS/grants-api/issues/103)
- **Deciders:** Andy Cochran, Emily Ianacone, Lucas Brown
- **Tags:** design

## Context and Problem Statement

Which tool should be used for wireframing and prototyping? The tool should facilitate design conversation, be easilty integrated into research activities, and provide artifacts for stakeholder review.

## Decision Drivers <!-- RECOMMENDED -->

- Platform availability
- Live collborative editing
- assets can be integrated into design research tools
- tool and assets must be accessible to internal partners (HHS or employed by HHS) and external partners (general public).
- Nava familiarity

## Options Considered

- Figma
- Adobe XD
- Sketch
- Invision Studio

## Decision Outcome <!-- REQUIRED -->

Chosen option: Figma, because it is not platform specific and its multi-user collaboration allows for easy remote pairing. It's assets can be easily shared, embedded, or integrated into research tools. Additionaly, Nava has the most familiarity with this option.

### Positive Consequences <!-- OPTIONAL -->

- Truss has developed [Figma assets using USWDS](https://www.figma.com/community/file/836611771720754351/U.S.-Web-Design-System-(USWDS))
- Figma's free tier does not require FOSS contributors to purchase licenses
- Figma has a robust community of plugins and integrations
- Includes Figjam (tho this may be redundant, depending on chosen whiteboarding tool)

### Negative Consequences <!-- OPTIONAL -->

- Collaborative nature of Figma requires connectivity and working online
- Tho version control and file management is possible, it can be difficult to track _who_ made recent changes

## Pros and Cons of the Options <!-- OPTIONAL -->

  - Browser-based (works on Mac, Windows, Linux…)

### Adobe XD
